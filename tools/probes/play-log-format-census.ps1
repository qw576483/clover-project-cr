# play-log-format-census.ps1 -- RE-COMPUTABLE census of the shared play-log's record/format mixture.
#
# WHY IT EXISTS (team-lead ruling 2026-09-23, approving CR-F2's proposal): the format contract landed in
# play-log.tsv states "history contains N date-time shapes" and "N records". Those numbers must be
# RE-DERIVABLE, not remembered -- the project rule is "扫描要重跑、不要记结果". This script is the载体
# for that. It is NOT wired into any gate (lead: do not hook it up yet).
#
# HARD RULE IT EMBODIES (earned three times tonight): a RECORD is determined by LINE-START + COLUMN
# POSITION. Counting by "the line contains an ISO-shaped substring" is wrong -- measured: a 509-char row
# quotes `2026-09-23T01:21:32 CR-T2x ...` inside its <why> and a naive scan reports a SECOND record.
# Counting by "the line contains a slice name" is wrong too -- bodies carry file names such as
# CR-V2-hud-mine.png.
#
# READ-ONLY on the real file. The only writes happen under -NegativeControl, only inside a fixture under
# .ai-tmp (refused otherwise), and the fixture is deleted afterwards.
