# dir-content-hash-blindspot-suite.ps1 -- the SHARED BLIND SPOT of the directory content hash, measured.
#
# WHY IT EXISTS (team-lead ruling 2026-09-23, option 2 of the two CR-F2 proposed): the manifest hash is
# now produced by exactly ONE implementation (tools/probes/cr-retain-assembly.py, CR-R1's). What must NOT
# be lost is the INDEPENDENT EVIDENCE that this key has a known blind spot -- so this file keeps ONLY the
# sandbox suite. It does NOT read index.tsv, does NOT compare recorded values, and is NOT wired into any
# gate. It produces NO content hash of any real artifact: the few values it prints are of a throwaway
# sandbox, obtained by running the authority's OWN functions.
#
# HOW IT CALLS THE AUTHORITY (measured constraint): the module has NO `__main__` guard, so importing it
#   would run its whole argparse pipeline. The helper parses the file with `ast`, keeps Import/FunctionDef
#   nodes plus only the module-level constants those functions reference, and execs that subset. The
#   SUBSET FINGERPRINT is printed so a change in the authority is visible (measured: it moved from
#   fa28f2151f824832 to 75ec3ff74dc44419 when CR-R1 landed the integer-nanosecond fix).
#
# THE TWO SENSITIVE BANDS OF THIS KEY (both measured, both must be stated wherever the value is used):
#   BAND 1  same-size in-place rewrite WITH the original mtime restored  => INVISIBLE (expected: a
#           file-level `path=mtime` entry has the identical blind spot, so the two are EQUIVALENT).
#   BAND 2  the millisecond field is rendered from st_mtime_ns (INTEGER nanoseconds). Any rendering that
#           passes through a float first -- datetime.fromtimestamp(st_mtime) rounds to the nearest
#           MICROsecond -- lands ONE MILLISECOND HIGH on a boundary (measured instance: a file whose true
#           value is 400.9998 ms renders .400 on the integer path and .401 through the float path; that
#           single file was the whole of the 2/6 cross-implementation gap). ⛔ Cross-implementation
#           comparison must align THIS point first; case5 below demonstrates the band in a sandbox.
#
# FAILURE MODES (team-lead rule 2026-09-23: a step that touches disk must state how it breaks):
#   - severity: LOW. Worst case = a LEFTOVER SANDBOX directory + a FAIL line. It deletes only $sbAbs, and refuses to run
#     at all unless that path is under .ai-tmp. => it cannot delete or rewrite a real artifact, and it
#     cannot touch the authority (it only reads it).
#   - severity: MEDIUM (a silent green would be worse). If the authority's functions cannot be extracted/executed it reports NOT-JUDGED and exits 4, never a
#     green.
#   - a truncated pipe (e.g. `| Select-Object -First N`) can kill this process mid-run, which would leave
#     the sandbox behind and skip the "sandbox deleted" self-check -- so do not truncate its output when
#     you care about its side effects.
#
# READ-ONLY on real inputs. Writes happen only inside a sandbox under .ai-tmp (refused otherwise); the
# sandbox is deleted afterwards and, when -Dir is given, the suite asserts that target's value is unchanged.

# (datetime.fromtimestamp rounds to microseconds) yields 401. ⛔ The float path is the REJECTED historical
# rendering and is printed ONLY to prove the band exists -- it never yields a value anyone may use.
# NOTE ON FORM: the band is about RENDERING, not about the filesystem, so the demonstration is driven by
# the measured constant (400999800 ns) instead of by a file whose mtime the volume may or may not keep to
# 100 ns. A file IS still written and read back, but only as an OBSERVATION of what the volume stores.

# SECOND, WORSE GOTCHA IN THE SAME LINE (measured): `$ticks / 10000` looks like integer division but

# it ROUNDED UP to ...401. So even `[Math]::Floor(...)` was useless: the precision was already gone.
